# Documentation

Developer documentation for the strategy-token launchpad on Robinhood Chain. Everything
here is plain Markdown with relative links, so it reads the same on GitLab, GitHub or a
local checkout. Diagrams are [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), which both render
natively.

**Prefer a site to a folder?** `pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-static-i18n jieba`, then `tools/docs_site.py serve` -- search, a sidebar, an English / 中文 switch and
rendered Mermaid at http://127.0.0.1:8000, assembled from these same files (nothing is written for it, and the repo stays
the source of truth). Keep it internal: SECURITY, AUDIT and the emergency runbook are in it.

**New here?** ARCHITECTURE → DEVELOPMENT → SECURITY, in that order, is about forty minutes
and is enough to review a pull request.

## The one thing to internalise

**Everything launched is immutable.** A token, its treasury and the one `HedgeFunHook` every
strategy's pool runs on have no upgrade path and no parameter that can change; the token has
no owner, the treasury's owner can only point its votes (`setVoteDelegate` — reserved, not
live), and the hook's owner — the same one, the factory's — can repoint each pool's two
payout addresses (the creator's only after a public 14-day wait the creator can veto) and do
nothing else. A bug that ships in a token or treasury ships forever, for every strategy
launched while it was there; a bug in the hook ships for **every strategy at once**. That is why the audit's fixes
landed before the first launch, why every fix has a regression test that was confirmed to
fail without it, and why [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/docs/SECURITY.md#rules-for-changing-the-code) has rules
for changing the code rather than suggestions.

## Evidence and analysis

These are records of work done, not living documentation: they say what was true when
they were written, and carry their dates.

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [V2_SIMPLE_CYCLE_AUDIT.md](./V2_SIMPLE_CYCLE_AUDIT.md), [V2_SIMPLE_CYCLE_BACKTEST.md](./V2_SIMPLE_CYCLE_BACKTEST.md) | Historical source #110 audit and frozen-price replay; their sizes and test counts describe the pinned source snapshot, with current target validation in the integration review |
| [`../AUDIT.md`](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/AUDIT.md) | Security review, 2026-09-20: three adversarial passes, 43 Foundry reproductions, a go/no-go, and the measured chain facts each finding was sized against. Status banners record which rounds fixed what |
| [STOCK_TOKEN_ASSESSMENT.md](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/docs/STOCK_TOKEN_ASSESSMENT.md) | What the real Robinhood stock token can do to a holder: beacon proxy, upgrader, deny-list, pause, `adminBurn`. Every row VERIFIED or INFERRED |
| [`../LISTING_CANDIDATES.md`](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/LISTING_CANDIDATES.md) | Which stocks can be listed (194 → 35 → 25), the first-wave decision, and what the feeds actually do across a weekend |
| [rule-backtest/](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/docs/rule-backtest/README.md) | What a creator's `tp1`/`dip`/`stop` would have done on eleven listed stocks, hourly, replayed forwards and backwards. About the **rule's economics**, not about whether a stock can be listed |
| [`../POOL_SELECTION.md`](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/POOL_SELECTION.md) | A *different* product — a delta-neutral LP hedged with a Lighter perp. Shares the pool census |
| [robinhood-chain/](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/docs/robinhood-chain/README.md) | Mirrors of three Robinhood Chain docs pages, each reconciled against what the chain actually does |
| [research/PONS_TAX_ELASTICITY.md](https://github.com/keyuyuan/hedgefund/blob/64c0adc602bbcbb70c0b4511ac67ee2aa40fceca/docs/research/PONS_TAX_ELASTICITY.md) | Does the trade tax predict volume and graduation? 106,631 pons.family launches on our chain, 2026-09-16 to 09-27, at a creator-chosen 1-11% tax. The same creator does as well at 2-5% as at 1%; above 5% volume halves and graduation nearly stops. Evidence for the 1-2% cap decision |

## Keeping these docs true

- **[REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) is generated** from the compiler's ABI output and the
  source's NatSpec by `tools/gen_reference.py`. Change the NatSpec, not the Markdown, then
  regenerate. A missing description in the reference is a missing `///` in the source.
- **`python3 tools/check_docs.py`** fails if any relative link or heading anchor in any
  tracked Markdown file is broken, or if the reference is stale. Run it before pushing
  anything that renames a file, a heading or a function.
- **A PR that changes behaviour changes the doc that describes it, in the same PR.**
  ARCHITECTURE for how it works, SECURITY for what it defends or accepts, OPERATIONS and
  `emergency/` for anything an operator would do differently. The root
  [`README.md`](../README.md) is the project's front page and the historical record of
  what each adversarial pass found; these files are what a maintainer works from.
- **Numbers rot.** Pool depths, TVL, feed ages and test counts in the analysis documents
  are dated measurements. Re-run the tool rather than quoting the figure.
- Keep it portable: relative links only, no platform-specific Markdown extensions, fenced
  code blocks with a language tag.
