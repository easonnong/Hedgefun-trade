/// @notice Strategy kind 1: a pure buy-back treasury. Opt-in: production must register its exact code chunks.
///
/// Graduation principal is protected and cannot fund buybacks. Subsequent fees and voluntary contributions can
/// fund buybacks. It opens no stock lot, never sells stock, and has no stop, take-profit or
/// dip. The stock leaves only through the inherited `buyback()`: one `buybackChunkUsdg` per `buybackCooldown`,
/// bounded by the pool's own TWAP/anchor and `maxBuybackImpactBps`, burning what it buys. Graduated V2 pools
/// keep the flat sell tax after each buy-back. Nothing about pacing, price limits or bounties is new.
///
/// Because it is `HedgeFunV2Treasury` with `book()` and `execute()` replaced, it takes the same constructor
/// arguments and serves the same surface the factory, hook, vault and routers call. The creator's tp/stop/dip
/// parameters are accepted and ignored; `lotCount()` is always 0 and `bookedStock` always 0.
///
/// What a keeper does: `claimFees` on the curve, `book()` here (or let graduation's own `book()` do it), then
/// `buyback()` whenever the cooldown allows. `execute()` reverts `UseBuyback`.
