The contracts live in [`contractV1/`](./contractV1/README.md). This is a self-contained Foundry project with source code, selected tests, ABIs, and pinned dependencies. V1 uses both Uniswap versions: a V4 pool for each strategy token and a V3 pool for stock/USDG execution.

The V2 source lives in [`contractV2/`](./contractV2/README.md), laid out the same way. V2 launches each strategy token on a stock-denominated bonding curve that graduates atomically into a locked V4 pool and a funded treasury. It is a separate deployment. The snapshot includes a public-testnet deployment and verification workflow; mirrored PR branches may include already-published testnet deployment records and mined receipts; see their pinned source provenance.

## Stack

| Component | Use in Hedgefun V1 |
| --- | --- |
| [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) | ERC-20, ownership, token-transfer safety, reentrancy protection, and math |
| [Uniswap V4 core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core) | Strategy-token pool, shared hook, and swap/liquidity types |
| Uniswap V3 pools | External stock/USDG execution; the required interfaces are in `contractV1/src/interfaces/IUniswapV3.sol` |
| [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) | Reproducible Solidity build and tests |

The V1 source snapshot is commit `5c28050cae10e73166aa993bdfe3c2cbf0b71823`; V2 provenance and validation are recorded in its [README](./contractV2/README.md). This organization repository is the current development baseline. New V2 deployments recommend a **1% base trading fee**, with the LP fee accounted for separately; historical deployments retain their frozen terms.

Use the [operations guide](./docs/OPERATIONS.md), [contract scope](./docs/CONTRACT_SCOPE.md) and [audit index](./audit/README.md) for current work. The [historical Hedgefund archive](./archive/hedgefund/README.md) preserves source-pinned audit rounds, PoCs, runbooks, emergency tools, public deployment records and measurements. Deployment credentials and third-party reference source are omitted. Historical evidence does not establish activation of newly merged contracts.

The original Hedgefun Solidity files are [MIT licensed](LICENSE). Git submodule dependencies retain their own licenses and copyright notices.
